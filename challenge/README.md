# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Description
An easily accessible portfolio page showcasing my progress during the front end bootcamp.


## Code highlights/ What was learnt during the challenge
What i found to quite bothersome doing this challenge was having to manually type in each class for styling whenever there was multiple other classes that required the identical styling in css. For instance in my about,contact and projects section. I was able to overcome this by experimenting and putting a comma in between each class like so : .about-me, .my-projects, .contact-me. This method turned out to be successful and saved quite alot of time of mine.
